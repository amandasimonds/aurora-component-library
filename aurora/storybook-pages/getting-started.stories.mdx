# Aurora Component Library

The Aurora Component Library is an Angular component library that I designed based on a fun, accessible color scheme and has light and dark mode. 

npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-aurora-pattern-library  
github https://github.com/amandasimonds/aurora-component-library

### Install

1. `npm install ngx-aurora-pattern-library` or `yarn add ngx-aurora-pattern-library`
2. Import styles: Add `"./node_modules/ngx-aurora-pattern-library/src/epd-material-theme.scss"` to the styles section of your angular.json.

### Dark mode

To enable dark mode, add `aurora-dark-theme` as a class to the `body` div on your index.html. 
Aurora will automatically switch to dark mode if the user's computer is set to dark mode on default.
